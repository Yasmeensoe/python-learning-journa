About Me
Hi, I'm Yasmeen Soe! I'm an incoming transfer student at UC Irvine for Fall 2024, where I'll be focusing on Artificial Intelligence. I hold an associate's degree in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics from West Los Angeles College. My programming background includes C++, Java, and Python, and I’m passionate about expanding my skills and knowledge in these areas. I’m also working towards earning an AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification.

Goals for This Course
My main goal for this course is to secure a summer internship by honing my programming skills and diving into hands-on projects, workshops, and research. I’m excited to learn more about AI and Machine Learning and to apply this knowledge to real-world problems. I'm eager to collaborate with others and contribute to innovative projects throughout this course.

# My First Python Program
print("Hello, World!")

# Reflections
After writing my first Python program, I felt a mix of excitement and accomplishment. Seeing the words "Hello, World!" printed on the screen was a small but significant milestone. It gave me a sense of confidence and curiosity to explore more in the world of coding. It may be a simple start, but it's the first step toward many more complex and rewarding projects!
