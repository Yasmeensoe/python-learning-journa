# Week 1 Reflections

This week, I began my journey into Python programming. Starting with the classic "Hello, World!" program, I learned how to write and execute a basic Python script. It was fascinating to see how Python's simplicity and readability make it an accessible language for beginners.

I also explored Python’s syntax and how it compares to other programming languages I’ve worked with, like C++ and Java. Python’s dynamic typing and lack of semicolons felt different at first, but it quickly grew on me. I’m excited to dive deeper into Python and explore more complex concepts in the coming weeks.
